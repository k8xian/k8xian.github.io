                    Innovations for Learning located in Evanston, IL. We work on a small team of four, which requires us to spend a lot of time outside
                    of our weelhouses. I do all the html &amp; css styling for my designs, and occasionally have to delve into JavaScript, which is why I am
                    presently enrolled in <a href="https://bootcamp.northwestern.edu/coding/" class="inline__textLink">Northwestern University's Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp</a>. I have been in the field of web design since 2012, with
                    experience in eCommerce, B2B marketing, and print design. After almost five years in New York City, I've moved to Evanston where I live with my boyfriend John and our cat named Khan. I enjoy 
                    lifting weights and running (which I enjoy less), playing video games, and drinking wine and craft beer. I also play the F horn, piano, and I sing.
