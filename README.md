## About Me
I'm Kate, a software designer & front-end dev for a literacy nonprofit called Innovations for Learning in Evanston, IL. We serve over 6,000 students every year, as our programs help struggling early-readers improve, both at home and in the classroom. Because we are a small team of four, I spend a lot of time having to think on my feet and work outside of my wheelhouse. 

I do all the html & css styling for my designs, and occasionally have to delve into JavaScript, which is why I am presently enrolled in Northwestern University's Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp; I also have a B.Arch in Architecture from the University of Miami in Coral Gables.  

I have been in the field of web design since 2012, with experience in eCommerce, B2B marketing, and print design. After almost five years in New York City, I've moved to Evanston where I live with my boyfriend John and our cat named Khan. I enjoy lifting weights, running, playing video games, and drinking wine & craft beer. I also play the F horn, piano, and sing.
