## About Me
I'm Kate, a software designer & front-end dev for a literacy nonprofit called Innovations for Learning in Evanston, IL. We serve over 6,000 students every year, as our programs help struggling early-readers improve, both at home and in the classroom. Intuitive design is especially important to me considering that our clients can't quite read... yet. Because we are a small team of four, I spend a lot of time having to think on my feet and work outside of my wheelhouse.

I do all the html & css styling and much of the front end JavaScript for my designs after enrolling in Northwestern University's Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp; I also have a B.Arch in Architecture from the University of Miami in Coral Gables.

I have been in the field of web design since 2012, with experience in eCommerce, B2B marketing, and print design. After almost five years in New York City, I've moved to Evanston where I live with my boyfriend John, our cat named Khan and our new puppy named Laika. I enjoy lifting weights, running, playing video games, and drinking wine & craft beer. I also play the F horn, piano, and sing.
